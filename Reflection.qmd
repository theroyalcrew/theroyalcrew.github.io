Reflection on using Quanto with GenAI

## GenAI used <br>
ChatGPT as I have apyed for it <br>
Perplexity is something I intend to start using as well

## What I learned <br>
It is very benefitial at quickly grabbing information. I am able to quickly do searches for like shortcuts and systex for Quanto.

## What I feel could be improved <br>
I feel like it makes my research skills very lacking and its definatly something I could use AI to advance and not just hinder.
